# Sorting Hats

## Description
To start off with, the project will use a bootstrap jumbotron to have your sorting hat introduce itself and start the sorting process (by clicking on a button). A bootstrap form will then appear to fill in the student's name and a button to sort. This should then assign the student to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin). On sorting a student, the form should clear and a bootstrap card with the student's name and house should print below the form. You should also be able to expel a student after they have been sorted, which should remove their card from the student record.
